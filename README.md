# Win32Serial
This piece of code can listen and talk to the a serial port used WIN32 Console App. C++ in Visual Studio 2013.

This program acts like a Hyper Treminal/Putty/Tera-Term or other serial communication terminals to talk to your electronics which are cnnected to your PC/Laptop. 

This software can READ from the serial port (LISTEN to the port) or can write into the port. Your electronics may read some special charcters and respond to them back. This is the best way of data acquisition. 

Please keep in your mind that, this code has still more room to progress. Therefore, feel free to go ahead and improve the code by adding Error Handling and extra features!
